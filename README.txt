# VITYARTHI-PROJECT-1-
Vityarthi's first project 
Online Food Ordering System:

My online food ordering platform project made using Python is a simple application that allows users to view a menu, place food orders, and get a running bill using a terminal or console interface. The core features generally include:

Displaying available food items and their prices as a menu for the user to choose from.

Accepting user input to select one or multiple menu items for ordering.

Calculating and showing the total price of the selected items.

Optionally handling multiple orders, checking if inputs are valid, and managing user-friendly messages throughout the ordering process.


Installation

Install Python: Download and install Python 3.x from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

Download the project file: Obtain  project file (for example, project.py) and save it to a folder on the computer.

No additional dependencies: If the project uses only built-in modules like input/output, dictionaries, etc., no other packages are needed.


Usage

This project helps automate the food ordering process and demonstrates essential Python skills such as the use of dictionaries, conditionals, and user input handling. It serves as a foundational example for anyone wanting to understand both Python programming and the basic workflow of food ordering systems
